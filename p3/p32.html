Retaining his past life's wisdom, Arthur quickly becomes an exceptionally skilled mage, possessing multiple elemental affinities, advanced combat skills, and a deep bond with his dragon companion, Sylvie. Though highly intelligent and strategic, he struggles with the burden of power, often feeling responsible for protecting those around him. Throughout his journey, he forms strong relationships, particularly with his childhood friend Tessia Eralith, and learns to balance his immense strength with emotional growth.
