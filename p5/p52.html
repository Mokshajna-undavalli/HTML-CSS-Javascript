        <p>The Pokémon world is a vast and diverse fictional universe filled with unique creatures known as Pokémon, which coexist with humans in a society that revolves around training, battling, and studying these creatures. The world is divided into multiple regions, each inspired by real-world locations, and each with its own distinct geography, culture, and native Pokémon species. Some of the most well-known regions include Kanto, the first region introduced, featuring iconic locations like Pallet Town and Viridian City; Johto, which is closely connected to Kanto and home to traditional and historical landmarks; Hoenn, a tropical region with vast oceans and islands, introduced in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire; Sinnoh, known for its mountainous terrain and deep lore about Pokémon creation myths; Unova, heavily inspired by New York City and featuring modern, urban environments; Kalos, based on France, with an emphasis on beauty and elegance; Alola, a tropical island region based on Hawaii, where Pokémon and humans live harmoniously; Galar, inspired by the United Kingdom and featuring industrial cities alongside vast countrysides; and Paldea, based on the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), which introduced an open-world exploration system. Each region has its own Pokémon League, consisting of Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and a Champion, who trainers must defeat to prove their strength. Pokémon trainers set out on journeys to catch and train Pokémon, filling their Pokédex, a digital encyclopedia of Pokémon species, while some aim to become Pokémon Masters.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The franchise's primary target audience is children aged 5 to 12, but it is known to attract people of all ages.<br >

            The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on 27 February 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.</p>
